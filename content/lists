# Lists

## Elements of a list

Each list you create comprises a collection of entities that you want to screen for, such as high-priced products or high-risk countries or regions. After you create a list, you enter a list name and a brief description to summarize its contents.

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure that DFP can correctly interpret the data files you upload, files must be in CSV UTF-8 (comma delimited) format (*.csv).
CSV files must also include column headers. For example, a list of Purchase data may include headings such as purchases, payment methods, zip codes, etc.
When you download a list, DFP opens it in Excel.

## Access the Lists management page

You can manage existing lists and create custom lists in the List management tab.

#### To access the Lists management page:

- In DFP, click **Account Protection** and then click **Lists** in the left navigation bar.

## How to use lists

You can create data lists which contain values of any type. For example, you could create a list containing email addresses, IP addresses, product IDs, or names of countries. You can then use these lists in ways that are best suited to your business needs.
For example, you can create a list of email addresses you consider risky based on their past transaction history:

|Risky Emails |
|--------------|
|alia@gmail.com |
|sarah@gmail.com |
|michael@gmail.com |
|jake@gmail.com |

You can configure a rule such that if a transaction or login attempt is made using an email address on a specified list, the transaction will always be rejected. Or if a transaction is for a product on a different list, configure the rule so it will always be accepted.

### Single- vs. multiple- column lists

You can create a single-column list with values representing a specific key (for example, email address) or a multi-column list with values relevant to several keys. For example, instead of having one single column list with *Safe Emails* and another single column list with *Risky Emails*, you could combine these keys into one *Emails* List with both an *Email Addresses* column and a *Status* column to indicate whether each email address should be found **Safe** or **Risky**, as shown in the following example.

|Emails|Status|
|--------------|--------------|
|alia@gmail.com |Safe|
|sarah@gmail.com|Risky|
|michael@gmail.com|Risky|
|jake@gmail.com|Safe|

You may also have a list product IDs, each of which are varying levels of risk. Therefore, in order To create a rule that is tailored perfectly to your business needs, you may want to evaluate each of these products against their own score threshold. (i.e., you want to reject product 123 only when it's risk score is greater than 950, but perhaps product 012 is inherently higher risk, and you want to reject anytime it's risk score is greater than  even 250).

You can create rules that are tailored perfectly to your business. For example, if you have products with varying risk levels, and you want to evaluate each product against its own score threshold: 

1. Create a list of product IDs, each of which indicates varying levels of risk. For example:

    |Product ID    |Score Threshold|
    |--------------|--------------|
    |123    |950|
    |456    |300|
    |789    |675|
    |012    |250|

1. Create a rule where you set a higher rejection threshold for a lower-risk product by setting a risk score that is greater than 950.
1. Within the same rule, set a lower rejection threshold for another inherently higher risk product by setting a risk score that is greater than 250.

## Create a list

Creating a new list in DFP is a two-step process:

- First, create a .CSV file in Excel with all the criteria you want to include. For example, you can create a list with all the zip codes in your state, or all the country codes for the countries in which you do business.
- Next, use the steps below to upload the .CSV file to DFP.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to caching, changes saved to existing lists may take up to two minutes to become active.

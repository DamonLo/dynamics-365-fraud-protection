# View account protection schemas

This topic outlines the schemas for historical data that is bulk-uploadedpassed into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection as comma-separated values (CSV) files. For information about the upload procedure, see [Upload historical data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/data-upload). If data will be ingested via the application programming interface (API), see [Integrate Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection real-time APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/integrate-real-time-api).

Note the following formatting guidelines throughout:

- The files are in CSV UTF-8 (comma delimited) format (\*.csv).
- The maximum file size is 10 gigabytes (GB).
- The  **DateTime**  columns are in ISO 8601 format. For example, **DateTime.UtcNow.ToString(&quot;o&quot;)** might have the result  **&quot;2019-03-14T20:18:11.254Z&quot;**.
- The decimal precision is two decimal places.
- The following characters are escaped in all columns: commas, new line characters, and multiline characters.

## **AccountCreation**

The following schemas are used in the Evaluate, andEvaluate and Protect experiences.

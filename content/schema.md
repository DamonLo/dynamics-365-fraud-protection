# View purchase protection schemas

This topic outlines the schemas for historical data that is bulk-uploaded into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection as comma-separated values (CSV) files. For information about the upload procedure, see [Upload historical data](data-upload.md). If data will be ingested via the application programming interface (API), see [Integrate Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection real-time APIs](integrate-real-time-api.md).

Note the following formatting guidelines throughout:

- The files are in CSV UTF-8 (comma delimited) format (\*.csv).
- The maximum file size is 10 gigabytes (GB).
- The **DateTime** columns are in ISO 8601 format. For example, **DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("o")** might have the result **"2019-03-14T20:18:11.254Z"**.
- The decimal precision is two decimal places.
- The following characters are escaped in all columns: commas, new line characters, and multiline characters.

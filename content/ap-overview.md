# Account protection overview

[!include [banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

As incidents of data breaches and bot attacks increase, account takeover has become a significant risk for many companies, regardless of the industry. Account protection leverages Dynamics 365 Fraud Protectionâ€™s proprietary risk assessment engine, artificial intelligence learning capabilities, and Fraud Protection network. These features provide device forensics and bot detection capabilities. 

With real-time telemetry through APIs, attributes associated with events such as account creation and account sign-in attempts are evaluated and return a risk assessment score with a reason code. Customers can leverage this information to make decisions and take proactive measures, such as blocking fraudulent attempts or challenging suspicious attempts with two-factor authentication.

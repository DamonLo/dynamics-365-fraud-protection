# Account protection overview

[!include [banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

As incidents that involve data breaches and bot attacks have become more frequent, account takeover has become a significant risk for many companies, regardless of the industry. Account protection takes advantage of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection's proprietary risk assessment engine, artificial intelligence (AI) learning capabilities, and Fraud Protection network. These features provide device forensics and bot detection capabilities.

You can obtain real-time telemetry through application programming interfaces (APIs). You can process attributes that are associated with events such as account creation and account sign-in attempts. The evaluation returns a risk assessment score together with a reason code. You can use this information to make decisions and take proactive measures, such as blocking fraudulent attempts or challenging suspicious attempts through two-factor authentication.

# Account protection Scorecard

Users intending to commit fraudulent activity might create fake accounts to obtain free or promotional benefits as a new user, or create sleeper accounts that can be leveraged later for fraud attacks against a merchant. These actions can lead to financial and non-financial losses. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection provides merchants the capability to assess accounts created in their ecosystem and protect themselves from abuse or automated attacks. This also helps minimize the impact to legitimate customers, thus maintaining a seamless sign-up experience.

# Security measures for protecting data 

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection has implemented, and will continue to maintain, appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect customer data and personal data. These measures are set forth in  Microsoft Security Policy. This policy is available to customers, as well as descriptions of the security controls in place for Fraud Protection and other information reasonably requested by the customer regarding Microsoft security practices and policies. 

For more information about Microsoft's security practice, visit the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center).

## Security assessment FAQs

### Authentication and administration

| Question| Response    |
|---------|-------------|
|Does the application / service support SSO through SAML 1.1, SAML 2.0, or WS-Fed?         |Yes. Portal: SPA - Oauth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, with implicit flow Service to Service backend API: Oauth 2.0  Fingerprinting Service: Anonymous Azure Stack: SAS Token for storage.|
|  Does the application support OKTA integration (SSO platform)         |This is not supported by default.  Azure AD supports custom integrations.  Since the merchant owns the tenant, the merchant can leverage AAD identity integration points. For more information, see the [Azure Active Directory documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/).|
|Is there a "backdoor" URL that allows users or administrators to bypass SSO?         |No.             |
|Does the application / service support two factor authentication?         |Yes,  the merchant can enable this in their Azure Active Directory             |
|Describe the 2FA solution.         |This is an Azure AD feature. For more information, see [How it works: Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks).             |
|Does the application support application-level passwords?         |No, user and application identities are managed within the customer Azure Active Directory.         |
|Which hash or encryption algorithm is being used to protect passwords?  |N/A.           |
|Is hash salting being used?         |N/A.             |
|Does the application / service utilize automatic account provisioning? How is this accomplished? (On-demand via SAML, automated CSV feed over secure transmission, API,etc.)  Provide documentation.         |No and N/A.        |
|Does the application / service utilize an immediate account access termination, including closing open sessions?         |No, AAD token expiration aligns user access termination and not the session.             |
|  If account terminations are not automatic, is this action performed within 1 hour of an account access termination request?       |Yes, per AAD policy.             |
|  Note: Document the process.  All actions must be logged       |For more information, see the [Azure Active Directory documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/).             |
|  What is the session idle timeout of your application?       |Per AAD policy, it is in line with token validity period.             |
|Does the application / service utilize an automatic account deprovisioning process via an API?         |No.             |
|Does the application / service provide a disposition strategy for content attached to a user’s account upon deprovisioning?         |No, only audit logs are tracked and retained as features per OST Guidelines and Microsoft Privacy Statement.             |
|Does the application / service allow the administrator to explicitly grant authorization to data and capabilities following the least privilege model based on role and/or function?       |Yes, via AAD roles, Admin can grant access within their tenant.        |
|  A minimum expectation is support for Administrator role, User role, Read-Only Administrator (log) role, and unprivileged Administrator (no access to content) role.       |The App/Service doesn't have any additional roles other than the admin role. The admin role takes the responsibility of spinning out additional roles within their tenant. For information about how to add and remove roles, refer to the  Fraud Protection documentation.          |
|If there are sharing permissions within the application, does the application / service allow the administrator to review user requests for additional access to data?         |N/A.             |
|Does the application / service allow the administrator user the ability to distinguish “administrator users” and “regular users”?         |No.         |
|Document the rights that are available for the various roles within the application / service. Examples are read-only accounts, log audit role, etc.         |See the Fraud Protection onboarding guide.             |

### Auditing

| Question| Response    |
|---------|-------------|
|Does the application / service log information in an industry standard event format type, such as CSV, CEF, or Syslog?         |Log data is not shared by the product.  Service metrics and KPI's are surfaced via PowerBI views.             |
|Does the application / service collect or provide the following data:          |             |
|User Login / Logoff / Password Change / Failed Login Attempts         |Yes.  For more information, see [Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs).             |
|Audit logs of administrator actions (user account Create / Update / Delete), or application-specific actions.         |<p>An audit history of key changes such as rule or list updates is maintained by the application.  User account actions and corresponding audit history is controlled via AAD.  For more information, see the overview: [Azure Active Directory reports and monitoring documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/index) and [Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs).</p><p>For AZURE AD auditing, see core directory events for application role and group membership: [List of Azure Active Directory Audit Activities](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/motiba/2018/02/12/list-of-azure-active-directory-audit-activities/) for core directory events for application role and group membership. </p><p>For access to audits from AAD Portal, see [Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory porta](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs).</p>               |
|  Audit logs of user actions (document or content Create / Read / Update / Delete)       |N/A.  Only the admin role is supported.             |
|  Audit logs of metadata actions (Create / Read / Update / Delete).       |Yes.  Audit history of key changes such as list and rule updates are maintained.             |
|  Creation and Destruction for system-level objects as required for PCI compliant applications only.        |N/A.            |
|  All logs must contain the source IP of the user.       |AAD has IP in its logs.  Certain internal logs do not have end-user IP but can be correlated with AAD information.             |
|  Audit trails on any activities performed on PII.        |The only PII is in the audit history of rule and list changes.  This is read-only and cannot be modified.               |
|Provide sample set of log data, Logs must be maintained for a period of 1 year and encrypted at rest by the vendor.         |Logs are maintained per standard Microsoft Azure Online Services policy.             |
|Does the vendor have procedures in place to detect, report and alert on the downtime of the Customer instance within an hour of the instance of being down?     |Yes.            |
|  What information is provided to customer to validate the negotiated SLA?       |As a customer, you can make a server-to-server call to the service and be able to monitor SLA directly.             |
|  How is this notification reported to me as a customer?       |No proactive downtime notification is in place. It's currently part of the roadmap.             |

## Security assessment FAQs

### Authentication and administration

| Question| Response    |
|---------|-------------|
|Does the application / service support SSO through SAML 1.1, SAML 2.0, or WS-Fed?         |Yes. Portal: SPA - Oauth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, with implicit flow Service to Service backend API: Oauth 2.0  Fingerprinting Service: Anonymous Azure Stack: SAS Token for storage.|
|  Does the application support OKTA integration (SSO platform)         |Not by default.  Azure AD supports custom integrations.  Since the merchant owns the tenant, the merchant can leverage AAD identity integration points.             |
|Is there a "backdoor" URL that allows users or administrators to bypass SSO?         |No             |
|Does the application / service support two factor authentication?         |Yes - this is something merchant can enable in their Azure Active Directory             |
|Describe the 2FA solution.         |This is an Azure AD feature. For more information, see [How it works: Azure Multi-Factor Authentication ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks)             |
|Does the application support application-level passwords?         |No, User and Application idenitities are managed within the customer Azure Active Directory.         |
|Which hash or encryption algorithm is being used to protect passwords?  |N/A           |
|Is hash salting being used?         |N/A             |
|Does the application / service utilize automatic account provisioning? How is this accomplished? (On-demand via SAML, automated csv feed over secure transmission, API,etc.)  Provide documentation         |No and N/A             |
|Does the application / service utilize an immediate account access termination, including closing open sessions?         |No             |
|  If account terminations are not automatic, is this action performed within 1 hour of an account access termination request?       |Yes, per AAD policy.             |
|  Note: Document the process.  All actions must be logged       |N/A             |
|  What is the session idle timeout of your application?       |Per AAD policy, it is in line with token validity period.             |

|Does the application / service provide a disposition strategy for content attached to a user’s account upon deprovisioning?         |No, only audit logs are tracked and retained as features per policy.             |
|Does the application / service allow the administrator to explicitly grant authorization to data and capabilities following the least privilege model based on role and/or function?       |Yes, via AAD roles, Admin can grant access within their tenant.        |
|  A minimum expectation is support for Administrator role, User role, Read-Only Administrator (log) role, and unprivileged Administrator (no access to content) role.       |The App/Service doesn't have any additional roles other than Admin role. Admin role takes the responsibility of spinning out additional roles within their tenant.          |
|If there are sharing permissions within the application, does the application / service allow the administrator to review user requests for additional access to data?         |N/A             |
|Does the application / service allow the administrator user the ability to distinguish  “administrator users” and “regular users”?         |No             |
|Document the rights that are available for the various roles within the application / service. Examples are read-only accounts, log audit role, etc.         |See the Fraud Protection onboarding guide.             |

### Auditing

| Question| Response    |
|---------|-------------|
|Does the application / service log information in an industry standard event format type, such as CSV, CEF, or Syslog?         |Log data is not shared by the product.  Service metrics and KPI's are surfaced via PowerBI views.             |

|  Audit trails on any activities performed on PII.        |The only PII is in the audit history of rule and list changes.  This is read-only and cannot be modified.               |
|Provide sample set of log data , Logs must be maintained for a period of 1 year and encrypted at rest by the vendor.         |Logs are maintained per standard Microsoft Azure Online Services policy.             |

|  What information is provided to customer to validate the negotiated SLA?       |As a customer, you'll make a server to server call to the service and be able to monitor SLA directly.             |
|  How is this notification reported to me as a customer?       |No proactive downtime notification is in place. It's currently part of the roadmap.             |

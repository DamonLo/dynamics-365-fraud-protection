# Use the virtual fraud analyst

The virtual fraud analyst uses innovative artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide a compelling historical view of your data and to help you set up and adjust optimal [risk score thresholds](scorecard.md). This information can then be transformed into [rules](lists-rules.md) to help you decide, in real time, whether to accept or reject customer transactions.

The virtual fraud analyst helps you balance acceptable levels of lost revenue and customer support costs against chargebacks, fees, and refunds. Its configuration experience implements and tests your rules against historical customer data.

When you create your rules in the virtual fraud analyst, we recommend that you complete them in the following order:

1. **Create your most fine-grained rules.**

For example, build a custom list of products that are currently in a specific price range, and use that list to build your rule. Use filters on [standard ontology nodes and attributes](graph-explorer.md), and then select an appropriate [list](lists-rules.md) that contains the corresponding dataset. For example, a rule can be set to screen for high-priced products that are bought only by users who are in high-risk countries or regions. The virtual fraud analyst gives you more control and helps you stop more fraud in these subsets of your traffic.

2. **Create a "catch-all fraud" rule for all your traffic.**

You can create a catch-all rule for your traffic that suits your needs for all transactions, without tying it to a specific custom list. To do so through the virtual fraud analyst, simply skip step 1 in the instructions below and proceed to selecting a risk score.

## Virtual fraud analyst step by step

### Step 1 (optional)
In Step 1, select the target data (a combination of a node, attributes, and a list) that your rule will apply to. If you need to create a new list first, select **Create new list** to do so in the **List management** tool.

The following table defines the node and attribute combinations that you can use to build your lists. You can create up to three filters per rule, and you can create a total of 30 rules.

| Node | Attributes 
|---|---|
| User | CountryRegion |
| Device | DeviceType, IPCountryRegion |
| BillingAddress | CountryRegion |
| PaymentInstrument | Type |
| Product | Type, SKU, Category, Market |

When you've finished, select **Analyze**. This applies your settings to data from the purchase API and generates the interactive risk chart.

### Step 2
In Step 2, use the **Transaction data** graph to examine the effect of fraud upon your historical transaction data. You can choose a date range and a risk score range to filter your view. In the chart, the x-axis represents the risk score, and the y-axis represents the number of transactions.

The machine learning model in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection evaluates every transaction by using advanced adaptive AI. It then assigns a risk score. The higher the risk score, the higher the perceived risk. The machine learning model uses a risk score range from 0 through 999. This approach resembles the approach that the fraud protection network uses. 

Based on the risk score, from 0 through 999, the interactive chart shows the fraud impact on your revenue. The following categories are used: **Approved transations**, **Confirmed fraud** (which combines both chargebacks and refunds), and **Rejected transactions**. Hover over any point to see a detailed representation of the values.

To the right, in **Risk impact**, you can see the key metrics that are associated with the chart. Use its risk score slider to set your threshold and continue to refine the score in single-point increments after creating a rule in the next step.

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| Fraud catch rate | The fraudulent transactions that have been blocked. Rejections are always above the risk score that you select. |
| Customer friction | The approved transactions that have been blocked. Approvals are equal to or less than the score that you select. |

When you choose a risk score, a summary appears that explicitly defines when transactions will be rejected.

### Step 3
After selecting the risk score with the slider on the right, name your rule and set its status (active or inactive), then select **Create**. Note that due to caching, your new rule may take up to two minutes to become active.

## Balance fraud loss against opportunity loss

The goal of any world-class fraud protection system is to enable companies to maximize their bottom line. By using Fraud Protection, you can quickly find a risk threshold that helps protect against fraud but also minimizes the impact on your legitimate transactions.

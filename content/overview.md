# Loss prevention overview


Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection  Loss Prevention focuses on loss prevention practices and tools used in the physical locations of commerce. 

Microsoft has many years of experience protecting our own e-commerce businesses from fraud. We have developed a sophisticated technology stack that uses connected big data across multiple lines of business and applies cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) to help provide more accurate decisions in real time.

By using loss prevention, you can help protect your business from fraud through several innovative and advanced capabilities. Here are some examples: 

- [AI and insights from the fraud protection network](fraud-protection-network.md)
- [Device fingerprinting](device-fingerprinting.md)
- A [rules engine](lists-rules.md) and [virtual fraud analyst](virtual-fraud-analyst.md)
- A [graph explorer](graph-explorer.md) and [scorecard](scorecard.md)
- A [transaction acceptance booster](transaction-acceptance-booster.md)

# Working with Power Apps

Power Apps offer a low-code tool for intuitively creating full applications (mobile or desktop) inside of a drag-and-drop, formula-based web tool. These applications are useful for the more interactive and complex processes your organization may want to develop with Fraud Protection eventing data.

### Getting started

The following are useful resources for getting started with developing your own Power Apps.
- [App in a Day Power Apps Training videos with full curriculum that takes you from beginning to end of building out a Power App using CDS data](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/free-app-in-a-day-powerapps-training-and-more-from-pragmatic-works/)
- [Official Power Apps Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/)

### Sample Power App

The [D365 Fraud Protection Portal Admin App](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-Fraud-Protection-Samples/tree/master/power%20app%20sample) is integrated with Fraud Protection Event Tracing Data and CDS and serves as an admin toolbox application for the Fraud Protection Portal. The app is fully open-source and can be modified or simply used as a reference.

# Loss prevention overview

Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection loss prevention is an AI-based solution designed to help brick and mortar retailers decrease in-store fraud costs and improve operational efficiencies and revenue. Using the power of AI, loss prevention identifies anomalies and patterns that might be indicative of potential in-store fraud. The solution provides retailers with the benefit of connected knowledge of events that happen across the stores. It allows you to combat fraud associated with in-store events such as returns, improper discounts, merchandise mishandling and inventory turn-over with adaptive AI technology by continuously learning and adapting to evolving fraud patterns.

# Loss prevention overview

[!include [banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

The loss prevention feature in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection identifies anomalies and patterns that might indicate in-store fraud.

Microsoft has many years of experience protecting its own e-commerce businesses from fraud. It has developed a sophisticated technology stack that uses connected big data across multiple lines of business, and that applies cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) to help provide more accurate decisions in real time.

By using loss prevention, you can help protect your business from fraud through several innovative and advanced capabilities. Here are some examples:

- [AI and insights from the fraud protection network](fraud-protection-network.md)
- [Device fingerprinting](device-fingerprinting.md)
- A [rules engine](lists-rules.md) and [virtual fraud analyst](virtual-fraud-analyst.md)
- A [graph explorer](graph-explorer.md) and [scorecard](scorecard.md)
- A [transaction acceptance booster](transaction-acceptance-booster.md)

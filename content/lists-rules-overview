# Using Rules and Lists

## Overview

Rules and lists enable you to better manage fraud protection and tailor the behavior of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection to meet your business needs.

Rules shape real-time decision making by accepting or rejecting transactions based on conditions that you select. Within these rules, you have the ability to check against custom Lists of data which are relevant to your business.

These lists of data are created by you and can contain values of any type. For example, you could have a list containing emails, IP addresses, product IDs, or countries. The way you use these lists is up to you. For example, you could configure a rule such that if a transaction or login attempt was made using an email on a specified list, it should always be rejected.  Or if the transaction is for a product on a different list, it should always be accepted.

## What is a rule

A *rule* uses lists to shape real-time decision making by accepting or rejecting transactions based on conditions and risk score thresholds that you select.

Rules shape real-time decision making by accepting or rejecting transactions based on conditions that you select.  They enable you to check transactions against custom lists which are relevant to your business.

#### To create and manage rules:

- Click **Account protection** in the DFP left navigation, and then click * *Rules**.
    For more information about rules, see [Using Rules](using-rules.md).

### What are events

Events may include acceptance, rejection, challenges, and other user-defined settings. For more information about syntax for valid rules, see the [DFP Language Reference Guide](lang-ref.md).

These capabilities help define the parameters that apply to your unique business so that you can screen for risky account protection events. They are designed to help you manage the trade-offs that are inherent when you must prevent fraud and also help you enforce various policies including geofencing.

### What is a payload

A *payload* is the actual information in transmitted data. When you create a clause, DFP displays pane on the right of the window with a sample of the payload data for the account protection API for a given event. Changes are verified as you make them.

To create and manage rules, access the **Rules** page from **Account protection** in the DFP left navigation.
For more information about rules, see [Using Rules](using-rules.md).

## What is a list

A *list* is a collection of data saved in a .CSV file to give DFP a flexible way to access organized data. You can create any number of custom lists with data that suits specific business needs, for example, a *Safe* list, a *Block* list, a *Location by postal codes* list, and so on.

#### To create and manage lists:
- Click **Account protection** in the DFP left navigation, and then click * *List**.
    For more information about lists, see [Using Lists](using-lists.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Due to caching, changes saved to existing lists may take up to two minutes to become active.

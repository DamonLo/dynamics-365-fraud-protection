# Managing Lists

## Overview

Custom Lists provide you with a flexible way to upload and access organized data within DFP. You can create any number of custom lists containing data specific to your business needs. For example, you could create a list containing a set of email addresses, IP addresses or product IDs. These lists can then be referenced within a rule (link) in order to help you execute your business logic/fraud strategy at scale.

> [!NOTE]
> Lists do not display in an INT environment.

## Using Lists to execute business logic

Rules (link) are where custom logic is defined in order to automate decisions in your business. To do this effectively, you may reference any custom list within a rule.  For example, you may create a list of email addresses which are considered to be risky  based on past transactions, as well as a list for those which are considered to be safe

|Risky Emails |
|--------------|
|Kayla@contoso.com |
|Jamie@bellowscollege.com |
|Marie@atatum.com |

|Safe Emails |
|--------------|
|Camille@fabrikam.com |
|sarah@gmail.com |
|Miguel@proseware.com |
|Tyler@contoso.com |

You can then configure a rule such that login attempts using an email on the Risky Emails list, it is rejected, while those using an email on the Safe Emails list are approved. 

### Single- vs. multiple-column lists

As shown in the example above, you can create lists with a single column of values, representing some key (for example, email address). However, you can also also utilize additional columns to represent a set of values relevant to that key. For example, instead of having one single-column list containing *Safe Emails* and another single column-list containing *Risky Emails* you could combine this information into a single multi-column list, shown below:.

|Emails|Status|
|--------------|--------------|
|Kayla@contoso.com |Risky|
|Jamie@bellowscollege.com|Risky|
|Marie@atatum.com|Risky|
|Camille@fabrikam.com|Safe|
|Miguel@proseware.com |Safe |
|Tyler@contoso.com |Safe |

You could then configure your rule such that all login attempts using an email on this list, with the status *Risky* are rejected, while those using an email with the status *Safe* are approved.
In addition to utilizing multi-column lists to combine safe/block lists, they also may be utilized to specify the unique levels of risk associated with a set of products, emails, or countries. For example, if certain product types present different levels of risk to your business, you may want to make decisions for these products differently. Specifically, you may want to evaluate each product against its own score threshold (link to scoring). To do this, youâ€™d first want to create a list to represent this information, such as the below: 

|Product ID    |Score Threshold|
|--------------|--------------|
|Digital    |500|
|Consumable    |600|
|Physical    |750|

You could then configure a rule such that transactions involving products of each type are rejected when they are assigned a Risk Score (link) greater than the specified threshold.

## Create a custom list

To create a list within DFP, you must first create and save the list as a CSV file on your local machine. Note that the file must:
- Be in CSV format
-	Contain unique headers for every column 
-	Be less than 20mb

When you are ready to upload the list to DFP, navigate to the Lists page and follow the below steps:
1. Click **New list** on the upper left. 
1. Click **Browse** to locate the file. When you have selected the file, click **Open**. 

    DFP will open a preview of the file for you to review. Note that this preview will contain a maximum of 20 rows. 
    
1. To upload this file, click **Continue**. (To upload a different file, click **Cancel** and repeat Step 2). 
1. Add a name and description that will make it easy for your team to know how to use the List. 

    Note that this name cannot be changed after this step. 

1. Click **Create**. 

    Note that due to caching, this list may take up to two minutes to become active. 

## Update a list

1. In the DFP **Edit List** panel, click **Browse** to locate the file. Select the updated file from Step 3 and click **Open**. 
    
    DFP opens a preview of the file for you to review. Note that this preview contains a maximum of 20 rows. 

1. To upload this file, click **Continue**. (To upload a different file, click Cancel and repeat Step 4). 
1.	Click **Update**. Note that due to caching, the list may take up to two minutes to update.

- Select the list you want to download and click **Download** in the command bar at the top.

    When the list has been downloaded, an Excel icon displays in the lower left corner of the window.

1. Click the Excel icon on the lower left of the window to open the file.

#### To search for a list:

- Locate the **Search** box on the upper right, and type in a keyword. 

    This will search all List names and descriptions, and filter the results accordingly. 

- To remove the filter, delete the keyword from the **Search** box, or press the **x** to the right.

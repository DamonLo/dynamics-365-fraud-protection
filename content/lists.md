# Manage lists

## Overview

Lists allow you to upload and access organized data in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection. You can reference any list in a [rule](rules.md) to help execute your business logic and fraud strategy.

The **Lists** page has two tabs separating the two types of lists you can create: **Custom lists** and **Support lists**. 

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot view or create lists in the INT environment. You must use the PROD environment.

### Custom lists

Custom lists are created and defined by you. You can upload any number of custom lists and fill these lists with data specific to your business needs or fraud protection strategy. For example, you can create a list containing email addresses, IP addresses, or product IDs, as well as additional values associated with each entry. 

### Support lists

Support lists are system-defined lists of emails and payment instruments with a *safe*, *block*, or *watch* status, as well as an associated expiration date for each entry. While these lists can be viewed and downloaded from the Lists page, they can only be modified through the [Support page](risk-support.md).

### Required list formats

To upload a custom list in Fraud Protection, you must first create and save the list as a CSV file on your local machine. The file must meet the following requirements:

- It must be in CSV UTF-8 (comma delimited) format (*.csv).
-	It must contain unique headers for every column.
-	It must be under the maximum file size of 20 megabytes (MB).

## Use lists 

[Rules](rules.md) define custom logic that automate business decisions. To help you define this logic, you can leverage any list in a rule. For example, you can create a list of email addresses which are considered to be risky, and a separate list for those which are considered to be safe. You can then configure a rule so that login attempts using an email on the *Risky Emails* list are rejected, while those using an email on the *Safe Emails* list are approved. 

### Single and multiple-column lists

The example above results in two separate lists, *Risky Emails* and *Safe Emails*, with a single column of values representing a key (in this case, email address). 

<table>
<tr><td>

|Risky emails|
|--------------|
|Kayla@contoso.com |
|Jamie@bellowscollege.com |
|Marie@atatum.com |

</td><td>

|Safe emails |
|--------------|
|Camille@fabrikam.com |
|Miguel@proseware.com |
|Tyler@contoso.com |

</td></tr> </table>

However, you can use additional columns to  hold values relevant to that key. For example, instead of the two separate lists above, you can combine this information into a single multiple-column list, as shown below.

|Email address|Status|
|--------------|--------------|
|Kayla@contoso.com |Risky|
|Jamie@bellowscollege.com|Risky|
|Marie@atatum.com|Risky|
|Camille@fabrikam.com|Safe|
|Miguel@proseware.com |Safe |
|Tyler@contoso.com |Safe |

You can then configure your rule so that all login attempts using an email on this list with the status *Risky* are rejected, while those using an email with the status *Safe* are approved.

In addition to using multi-column lists to combine safe and block lists, you can also use multi-column lists to specify the unique levels of risk associated with a set of products, emails, or countries. For example, if certain product types present different levels of risk to your business, you can make decisions for these products differently. Specifically, you can evaluate each product against its own score threshold. To do this, you must first create a list to represent this information, as shown in the example below. 

|Product Type    |Score threshold|
|--------------|--------------|
|Digital    |500|
|Consumable    |600|
|Physical    |750|

You can then configure a rule that enforces that transactions are rejected when they have a [risk score](ap-scorecard.md#risk-model-score) above the specified threshold for that product type. For information on about how to create effective rules to customize your business logic, see [Rules](rules.md). 

## Upload a list
You can upload organized data in a list file to Fraud Protection and then reference the list in a [rule](rules.md).

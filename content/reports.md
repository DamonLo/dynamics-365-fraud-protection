# Viewing reports

Loss prevention identifies anomalies and patterns that might indicate in-store fraud. This report is generated as an output of analyzing historical data using adaptive AI that identifies patterns of anomalies in the data. These reports can enable the store managers and fraud investigators to focus the anomalous entities that might be indicative of potential fraudulent based in the risk score generated by the AI models. The detail reports provide trend analysis on return rate, discount rate, and other KPIs.

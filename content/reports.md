# Viewing reports

Loss prevention reports provide actionable insights in relation to the potental fraud happening from events that occur in the stores. This report is generated as an output of analysing historical data using adaptive AI that identifies patterns of anomalies in the data. These reports can enable the store managers and fraud investigators to focus the anomalous entities that might be potentially fraudulent based in the risk score generated by the AI models. The detail reports provide trend analysis on return rate, discount rate and other KPIs.

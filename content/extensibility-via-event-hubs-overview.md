# Extensibility via Event Hubs -  Overview

This documentation guides you through setting up and using the *event tracing data* available from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection. This includes, but is not limited to, **Audit Log**, **Latency**, and **Trace** events.

Through pure-code SDKs, you can integrate this data with your own organization’s workflows and requirements  for granular control and custom needs. Additionally, you can take advantage of quick, fast-development tools such as **Logic Apps**, **Power BI**, and **Power Apps** for powerful automations, reports, and applications. 

This guide is organized into the following main sections:

- [Setup extensibility via Event Hubs](extensibility-setup.md)	
- [Working with code](extensibility-with-code.md)
- [Working with Logic Apps/Power Automate]( extensibility-with-power-automate.md)
- [Working with Power BI]( extensibility-with-power-bi.md)
- [Working with Power Apps]( extensibility-with-power-apps.md)
- [Pricing](extensibility-pricing.md)


> [!NOTE]  
> Only the **Setup** section is *required*. The rest of the content is optional depending on your organization's needs. Each section contains subsections so you can skip around and review only the parts you need. The phrases *events*, *eventing data*, and *event tracing data* are used interchangeably. 
Read the **Notes** in each section *before* moving to another section.

# Manage Account Protection Rules and Lists

## Rules
You can use lists and rules to help automate your account protection decisioning. Rules shape real-time decision making by accepting, rejecting, challenging, and reviewing account protection events based on the conditions and risk score thresholds that you select. The rules use lists of data that you create that are relevant to your business. These capabilities help you define the parameters that are right for your business to screen for risky account protection events. They also help you enforce various policies, such as geofencing. These capabilities are designed to help you manage the trade-offs that are inherent when you must prevent fraud. 

Common operations associated with a rule are: 
- **New rule**: create a new rule.
- **Rename**: change the descriptive name of a rule.
- **Activate/deactivate**: determine if the rule is affecting assessment API. (link)
- **Delete**: remove a rule.
- **Move up/move down**: change the execution order of rule.
